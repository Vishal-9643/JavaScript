# JavaScript 
A summary of the concepts and projects I completed while learning JavaScript.


## 📘 What I Learned

### 1. Basics 
- Printing output on the console and showing messages in the browser using alert().

- Declaring variables and understanding the differences between var, let, and const.

- Converting data types (string ↔ number).

- Using built-in Math and Date objects.

### 2. Pre_Intermediates
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch).

- Looping statements (for, while, do…while).

- Arrays, functions (declaration and calling), this keyword, arrow functions.

- Working with objects.

### 3. DOM & Events
- Selecting elements, changing text (innerHTML), adding and removing elements.

- Event listeners, event bubbling, and how to prevent it.

- Creating promises, using .then() and .catch().

- Using async / await.


## 🧩 Projects 
### Project 1 : Background Color Changer
- Four color boxes are displayed, and clicking any box changes the page background to that color.

- The boxes are created using the button tag.  All buttons are selected using query selectors, and click event listeners are added using loops.

### Project 2 : BMI Calculator
- Takes height and weight as input and displays the calculated BMI.

- Uses a form with a submit event listener to perform the calculation and display the result.

### Project 3 : Digital Clock
- A simple digital clock that updates every second.

- Uses setInterval() to refresh the time display continuously.

### Project 4 : Guess the Number
- A number-guessing game where the user gets 10 attempts to guess the correct number.

- After each guess, the game tells the user whether the guess is too high or too low.

### Project 5 : Keyboard Checker
- Highlights the on-screen keyboard key when the user presses the corresponding key on the physical keyboard.

### Project 6 : Continuous Background Changer
- Automatically changes the background color every second when the Start button is clicked.

- Stops changing when the Stop button is clicked.
